// The <GifSearch /> component will render a form that receives the user input for the giphy search.
// The text input should be a controlled component that stores the value of the input in it's component
// state and renders the DOM accordingly. The React component is always in charge of what the DOM looks
// like. <GifSearch /> should receive a callback prop from it's parent. On a submit event, it should
// invoke that callback prop with the value of the text input. It is this callback function, defined
// in <GifListContainer />, that will actually query the api with the text the user has entered.
